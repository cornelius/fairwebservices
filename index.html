<h1>Fair Web Services</h1>

<h2>What makes a web service free as in freedom?</h2>
<p>Free Software puts users in charge of their computing. They have control. The Free Software Definition defines the freedoms which guarantee that. When using web services, that is software run by others, the Free Software Definition is not enough. Fair Web Services is an attempt to define criteria for web services which guarantee that users stay in control of their computing and retain the freedoms they have gained with Free Software.</p>
<p>This site is the collection point for defining criteria for Fair Web Services. It's the beginning of a journey and it is in flux. Take it as the base for a discussion and contribute your thoughts. Our goal is to refine that in a solid set of criteria which can be applied by providers and users of web services who care about freedom.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>There are a number of problems with the freedom of web services, which can't be addressed through Free Software.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Terms of Services</li>
  <li>Lock-in</li>
  <li>Sustainability</li>
  <li>Privacy</li>
  <li>Meta Data</li>
  <li>Triple Payment</li>
  <li>Security</li>
  <li>Hackability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>There are a number of attempts to solve the problems of freedom of web services. This is a list of relevant references.</p>
<ul>
  <li>GNU Affero Public License</li>
  <li>Franklin Street Statement on Freedom and Network Services</li>
  <li>GNU Ethical Repository Criteria</li>
  <li>ToS;DR</li>
  <li>User Data Manifesto</li>
  <li>Freedom Services</li>
  <li>Trusted Internet Services</li>
  <li>EFF's Best Practices for Online Service Providers</li>
  <li>Laws</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Fair Web Services certification</h2>
<p>None of the solutions is complete yet or has enough traction to serve as a widely accepted solution. The Fair Web Services Definition is the attempt to combine existing approaches and refine them to something which can be used by providers and users of web servcies to make sure that users of web services retain their freedom.</p>
<p>The idea is to create criteria for a certification of services. The certification would allow providers to show that they respect the freedom of users and give users a guideline about what services to use.</p>

<h3>Criteria</h3>

<h4>Subtitutability</h4>
<p>The key criterion is that users are able to substitute a service by another services if they wish. This gives users control as they can take their data and move to a service which better serves them or even run the service themselves.</p>
<p>Subsitutability requires well-defined APIs to access the data and functionality, so you can build import tools for other services, support of open protocols, so interoperability of different services becomes possible, that users own their data, a provision for succession in case the service stops operating, and that there are alternative implementations available or possible.</p>

<h4>Transparency</h4>

<p>Transparency is important, so that users can judge what the service does and how that affects their computing. Transparency of terms of use is especially important. But also transparency about what is done with the data, where it's stored and processed.</p>

<h4>Privacy</h4>

<p>Services need to respect the privacy of users and give them ultimate control about what happens with their data. Personal data should only stored when necessary, and it has to be documented what is happening with it. Users need to be able to leave a service and have all their data removed.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>When running Free Software yourself, you have control about the security of the software, you can inspect the code, analyze it, and fix issues, when necessary. For services this is not possible. They need to establish trust that they are operating in a secure way and are protecting the data of their users. They should use encryption where possible. They need to document procedures how to identify and fix security issues. They need to communicate security issues clearly to their users.</p>

<h4>Fair model of operation</h4>

<p>Paying for a service is ok. Running web services can be costly, and users paying for their share of the costs is a fair model. Creating artificial restrictions as pay barriers, especially to the users own data, is not fair. A user should never be forced to pay for getting access to their own data. A fair web service should also not use third party advertisements, because that introduces tracking of users by third parties, and the users loses control about this data. Users also lose control about what is shown along their own data.</p>

<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>The idea of Fair Web Services was presented at a couple of conferences. Recordings from GUADEC and Akademy are available.</p>
