## Substitutability

The key criterion for a Fair Web Service is that users can substitute it by another service if they wish. This gives them control and freedom of choice. Users need to be able to move their data to another service which serves them better or even run the service themselves.

* The service has an API (application programming interface) which allows users to access all the data they own so that they can extract their data and move to another service provider.
* The API can be accessed under the same terms and with the same quality of service as all the other ways the user access their data so that it's practical for users to extract their data and they don't have to cross additional barriers such as extra payment.
* Users don't give up any rights on the data they provide to the service so that they can give it to another service provider without restrictions.
* It's technically and legally possible to run an equivalent service so that other service providers can run a substitute service. An open source implementation of the service or if the service implements standardized protocols matches this criterion. It also means that no essential part of the service can be prevented to be reimplemented by others through patents.
* There is a provision for succession in case the service stops operating so that users have the opportunity to move to another service. This includes guarantees to make the service and data available for a reasonable time after it announces to close down. An agreement to transfer the service and its data to another provider under the same or more free terms matches this criterion.
