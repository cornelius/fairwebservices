## Security

Applying standard security measures should go without saying for any service. But it's even more important to also establish trust with the user. When relying on a service run by somebody else, users can't check for themselves what is done to keep the service secure. So the service provider has to build trust by being transparent and reactive about security.

* The service only uses https and not http so that all data traffic is encrypted and clients can make sure that they are talking to the actual service. This keeps private data secure and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
* The service provides two-factor authentication or another mechanism which is at least as secure so that users account can't be compromised by hacking only the password.
* There is a documented way how to report security issues and how they are handled so that users and security experts have a way to improve the security of the service.
* The service provider keeps an ongoing report of security issues and how they were fixed so that users can judge how security is handled for the service.
