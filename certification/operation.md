## Fair model of operation

This is about the business model behind the service. Just like with Free Software the key is to find the balance of maintaining freedom and control for the user and allowing to build a commercial business around the service. This is not about providing everything gratis, but about a fair model, where users have a choice to pay for a service because they get the value they desire.

Unlike Free Software where distribution is basically free and developers of the software have no costs with people running their software, running a web service does cost money and the cost scales with the number of users and what they are doing. So a fair model needs to allow for a way to cover these costs.

* Paying for the costs of a service in a transparent way is fine so that the service can be run sustained by its users.
* Access to data owned by the user must never cost extra so that users always can get to their data without artificial barriers.
* There is no third-party advertisement on the service so that users aren't tracked by advertisement networks and they don't lose control about what is shown alongside their own data.
* All parts of the service are available to all users under the same conditions (which might vary depending on what part of the service it is) so that everybody is aware of what the service provides and can make use of it if desired.
