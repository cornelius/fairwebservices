## Transparency

Transparency is important to give the user the means to consciously decide about the pros and cons of using the service. It makes it possible to make an informed choice about what services to use and what that does to control of data and freedom of usage.

* There is a clear, concise, and understandable version of the terms of use in non-legalese so that everybody is practically able to understand the terms before using the service. "Terms of Service; Didn't read" (https://tosdr.org) provides one way of doing this. Summarizing and explaining the terms such as Kickstarter does it (https://www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use) might be another way.
* There is a clear and complete statement of how what is done with user-generated data so that users know in advance what happens to data they upload to the service.
* There is a clear and complete statement of who has access to which parts of user-generated data and under which conditions so that users are in control of who is seeing their data.
* There is a clear and complete statement of where data is processed and stored so that users can decide if they want to put their data under the jurisdiction of the location where the data is processed and stored.
* If user-generated data is shown to other users the user who owns the data has a way of viewing the data in the same way other users see it so that users are in control of how their data is presented.
